# Smart E-Commerce Orders Data Engineering Pipeline (PySpark)

A full end-to-end **Data Engineering Pipeline project** built using **PySpark** and a modern **Bronze → Silver → Gold** layered architecture.

This project simulates how real-world companies process raw e-commerce transaction data into clean analytics-ready datasets, build Star Schema models, generate KPI reports, and detect fraud patterns.

It is designed as a strong portfolio project for Data Engineering roles.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This pipeline processes raw online order data and performs:

- Data ingestion from CSV (Bronze Layer)
- Cleaning and transformation (Silver Layer)
- Fraud detection logic
- Star Schema modeling (Gold Layer)
- Business KPI reporting for analytics

The output datasets are stored in **Parquet format**, which is widely used in production data lakes.
